# Operating Framework
The World Economic Quorum convenes innovators, communities, builders, and leaders across all domains to co-create global, regional, and sectoral strategies. It is decentralized, impartial, free from centralized capture, and upholds the highest standards of transparency, integrity, and collective accountability.

Unlike legacy institutions bound by geography, the Quorum exists as a distributed digital network with nodes across the world. Its infrastructure is natively global, leveraging open protocols and interoperable systems to enable borderless participation, collaboration, and trust.

Founded as a response to the shortcomings of hierarchical governance, the Quorum operates as a living ecosystem—continuously evolving to meet the demands of an interconnected, rapidly changing world. It engages stakeholders through open dialogue, decentralized governance, and binding commitments to action, enabling societies to become more adaptive, resilient, inclusive, and future-ready.

Commons
The Quorum’s work is accelerated by Digital Commons and open systems where communities of purpose align with ambitious goals through competitive cooperation. We architect systems and incentives necessary to address planetary-scale challenges, coordinating resources and collective intelligence. Guided by community consensus, we transform ambition into executable action through transparent roadmaps, iterative projects, and open knowledge generation.

Assemblies and Congresses
The work of the Commons is amplified through Assemblies and Congresses where stakeholders convene to deliberate, decide, and commit to shared objectives. These gatherings are designed to foster inclusive dialogue, harness collective intelligence, and catalyze coordinated action. Assemblies focus on specific themes or sectors, while Congresses bring together a broader spectrum of voices to address overarching challenges and opportunities.

Impact
We build trust through transparency, empower decision making through open data and analytics, and accelerate execution through decentralized coordination. Our efforts include trust pacts forged between historically opposed communities, open intelligence reports mapping systemic risks and opportunities, and hundreds of distributed initiatives designed to elevate human prosperity, restore ecological balance, foster diplomacy beyond borders, and steward the governance of transformative technologies.

# Stewardship

The World Economic Quorum is not merely an institution, but a trust. Stewardship is the covenant between its contributors, leaders, and community—a recognition that the Quorum exists to serve civilization beyond the span of any single lifetime or agenda.

At its highest level, stewardship rests with the principal governors, who safeguard the balance of power and ensure the Quorum’s direction remains aligned with its founding mission. This mantle of responsibility is extended to the Councils and Committees, whose members are bound not only by rank, but by duty to act as custodians of the Quorum’s integrity, reputation, and purpose.

True stewardship is measured not by ownership, but by accountability. Members at every tier—from the Council of 13 to the 144,000—are entrusted with the responsibility to protect the Quorum’s values, contribute to its commons, and embody its principles of transparency, cooperation, and innovation. To steward the Quorum is to recognize that individual actions ripple outward, shaping both the destiny of the network and the trajectory of humanity.

Stewardship demands discipline, humility, and vision. It requires each participant to think beyond personal interest, embracing their role as caretaker of something larger than themselves. Through this shared guardianship, the Quorum sustains its legitimacy, evolves with wisdom, and remains an enduring beacon of collective progress.

# Origins
The World Economic Quorum began as a grassroots movement born out of a shared vision between entrepreneurs, system designers, and movement builders who recognized the urgent need for a new model of coordination and governance. What united these early contributors was the conviction that legacy institutions, bound by hierarchy and inertia, could not keep pace with the exponential changes reshaping civilization.

WEQ emerged as a direct response to systemic failures: financial systems unable to provide resilience, governance structures unable to adapt, and institutions unable to restore trust. It was not founded to reform the old order, but to create a lasting alternative ecosystem that is transparently driven by collective action towards positive outcomes.

From its inception, the Quorum has been powered by human ingenuity and collective intelligence. Every line of code, every assembly, and every act of contribution built upon the last, transforming an idea into a digital commons capable of uniting diverse actors across borders, sectors, and ideologies. Its strength has never been derived from central authority, but from the voluntary alignment of those committed to building a future that works for all.

These origins remain the compass of the Quorum: a reminder that every member, regardless of rank or role, stands on the same foundation of shared purpose—to ensure civilization not only adapts to change, but thrives because of it.


# Leadership and Governance
The World Economic Quorum models a new standard of decentralized-yet-structured governance, where legitimacy, accountability, transparency, and collective action are the guiding principles. Rather than concentrating power, stewardship is distributed across layered councils and assemblies, ensuring both agility and resilience in decision-making.

The Quorum is guided by two Principal Governors, who provide strategic direction and act as custodians of mission and values. Surrounding them are tiered councils that balance leadership with accountability. The Council of 13—comprised of the highest contributors—serves as guardians of the Quorum’s integrity and long-term vision, with members competing cooperatively to secure their place through demonstrated impact and contribution.

The Council of 33 functions as the executive body of the Quorum, coordinating initiatives, setting priorities, and translating collective ambition into actionable outcomes. In parallel, the Committee of 300 draws on deep domain expertise across regions and disciplines, channeling specialized knowledge to ensure decisions are informed, adaptive, and forward-looking.

Beyond these councils, the Quorum’s governance extends to its Executive Assembly of 144,000 open seats, reserved for the most dedicated contributors across the community. This Assembly serves as the participatory backbone of the Quorum, where members propose initiatives, share input, and cast votes. This model ensures governance remains both representative and merit-based.

At the broadest tier, the Quorum is powered by an open global assembly of contributors, whose collaborative intelligence drives innovation and whose collective actions shape the trajectory of civilization. In this layered design, authority is not imposed but earned, ranked according to contribution, and continuously renewed through open participation.

Together, this living governance structure ensures that the Quorum remains transparent, accountable, and oriented toward advancing humanity through trust, cooperation, and collective purpose.
